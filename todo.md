- is there a way to deterministically create zkApp accounts from the collection zkApp account. That would allow for a very efficient onchain mapping from tokenId to NftAccount. Otherwise this has to happen offchain. The ` getAccountOf(address: PublicKey)` method of the fungible token standard might lead into the right direction here.
